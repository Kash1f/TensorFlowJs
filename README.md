# TensorFlow.js Projects with ml5.js

Welcome to my collection of TensorFlow.js projects built using the powerful ml5.js library! This repository showcases a variety of projects demonstrating machine learning concepts and applications in a fun and interactive way.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**
   A machine learning-powered rock-paper-scissors game that lets you play against an AI model trained to recognize hand gestures. Test your skills and see if you can beat the AI!

### 2. **Neural Network Basics and Advanced**
   - **Basic Neural Network**: A simple implementation showcasing how neural networks function.
   - **Advanced Neural Network**: A more in-depth example exploring advanced neural network concepts and functionality using TensorFlow.js and ml5.js.

### 3. **Transfer Learning**
   Explore the concept of transfer learning with pre-trained models to adapt them for new tasks. A great way to leverage existing machine learning models for custom use cases.

## Tech Stack
- **TensorFlow.js**: A JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models in the browser.
- **ml5.js**: A user-friendly library built on top of TensorFlow.js, making machine learning accessible to everyone.
- **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**: The foundation of web-based applications.

## How to Run the Projects
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
3. Open the respective project folder and run the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser.
